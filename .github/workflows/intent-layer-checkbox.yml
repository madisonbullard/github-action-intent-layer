# Intent Layer Checkbox Handler
#
# Handles checkbox toggles in Intent Layer PR comments.
# When a user checks/unchecks an approval checkbox, this applies or reverts the change.
#
# Works with:
# - GitHub Actions (real CI)
# - Act (local testing - limited, as issue_comment events are hard to simulate)
